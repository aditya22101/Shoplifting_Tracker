# 🛒 Shoplifting Detection and Tracking System (Streamlit + Deep Learning)

An interactive web-based application to detect and track shoplifting behavior from uploaded surveillance videos using a deep learning model. The system highlights suspected activity and provides an annotated output video along with a detailed CSV log.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights
 
- 📦 Upload and analyze surveillance videos (`.mp4`)
- 🎯 Detect shoplifting behavior using a trained deep learning model (`model.h5`)
- 📽️ Annotated video output (`out.mp4`) with visual indicators
- 📊 Downloadable CSV logs (`out.csv`) with frame-level detection data
- 💻 Built with Streamlit for fast, browser-based interaction
