# 🛒 Shoplifting Detection and Tracking System (Streamlit + Deep Learning)

An interactive web-based application to detect and track shoplifting behavior from uploaded surveillance videos using a deep learning model. The system highlights suspected activity and provides an annotated output video along with a detailed CSV log.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights
 
- Upload and analyze surveillance videos (`.mp4`)
- Detect shoplifting behavior using a trained deep learning model (`model.h5`)
- Annotated video output (`out.mp4`) with visual indicators

---

## 🚀 Live Demo (Optional)

*Coming Soon — Will be hosted on Streamlit Cloud or Render*
